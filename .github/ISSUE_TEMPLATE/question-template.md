You can filter issues labeled as "question" in the issue tab, by filtering on labels (by clicking on the "Labels" button at the right of the issue search bar) and selecting only the "question" label. Please make sure to review both open and closed issues (you can display all issues at once by removing the `is:open` filter in the search tab).
